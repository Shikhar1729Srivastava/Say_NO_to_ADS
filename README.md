This is a simple Chrome extension designed to block unwanted ads while browsing. It uses the Declarative Net Request API to block ads from specific domains like Google Ads and DoubleClick. The extension allows users to toggle the ad-blocking feature on and off through an intuitive popup interface.
Features
Block Ads: Automatically blocks ads from well-known ad-serving domains such as googleadservices.com and doubleclick.net.
Toggle On/Off: Users can easily enable or disable the ad blocker using a toggle switch in the popup.
Dynamic Rules: The ad-blocking rules are applied dynamically, meaning the user can turn the ad-blocker on or off without restarting the browser.
User-friendly Interface: A simple and clean interface with a status indicator showing whether the ad blocker is active or inactive.
